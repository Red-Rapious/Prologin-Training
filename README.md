# Prologin-Training
My solutions for some of the Prologin problems.

## About
[Prologin](https://prologin.org) is a French programming contest in which I participated in 2020.

The [exercises of previous editions](https://prologin.org/train/) provide a great material to train in algorithmic; this repository contains my solutions for some exercices that I resolved to train.

## Running
Different problems are solved using different programming languages. Each folder of this repository is named after the language used.

### Rust
A `Cargo` project is configured. You can simply run the default tests from Prologin by launching:
```console
$ cd rust
$ cargo test
```

### Python
Execute each file by running:
```console
$ cd python
$ python3 file_name.py
```

For Windows:
```console
> cd python
> py src/python/main.py
```
